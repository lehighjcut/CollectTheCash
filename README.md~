# CollectTheCash
To play the game: Go to https://lehighjcut.github.io/CollectTheCash/

The goal is to collect as much money as possible by the end of the 30 second timer. You may move the trash can left and right by using the arrow keys, or you can move it by clicking and holding on the left or right half of the screen.
After the 30 seconds, you will be displayed your highest 5 scores since the last time your browser was cleared out.

Try to beat my high score of 1067 :)
